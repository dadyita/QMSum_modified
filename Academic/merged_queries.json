        "answer": "The team has adopted XML as their standardized data format, although there are concerns about its limitations. One concern raised is that sometimes the microphone of one subject picks up sound from another. The team also discussed the implementation of tools to help participants identify when the audio quality is poor. C has developed an XML format that links utterances based on time tags, creating a lattice structure. Each section of the XML format has its own ID and timeline tag. While the format is easy to use, it is not efficient for smaller linguistic units like phones. It works best for word units. F is concerned about how the time labels would adjust to smaller phonetic units and suggests propagating new information throughout the XML to change the time boundaries. However, this could result in large file sizes. A has seen a similar XML format before and believes that the time boundaries are well-handled. However, A is not too concerned about dealing with smaller linguistic units as it is not a frequent problem."

        "answer": "The team discussed the best approach for incorporating the recording infrastructure in the room, considering options such as placing tapes in the lip of the table and using LEDs to indicate when the channel is live. Power issues were also a topic of discussion. In terms of representing the Bayes-net, an alternative approach was proposed that depicts context features as classes and their dependencies as relations. This model allows for instantiations of classes, which aligns better with the research objectives compared to the extended belief-net. Recent experiments revealed that adding more languages had a detrimental effect on model performance. However, it was noted that any form of normalization had a positive impact, while MSG had no effect. A demonstration was given on the structure and function of a toy version of the belief-net for the intentionality task. The feature nodes included prosody, discourse, verb choice, the \"landmark-iness\" of a building, time of day, and whether the admission fee was discussed."

Around 11 hours of speech have been transcribed. Grad F shared his work on building a system that classifies intermediate categories using multi-band techniques, which can improve phoneme recognition performance. This method can be applied to large vocabulary tasks like switchboard. Approximately 12-13 hours of Meeting Recorder data have been collected, with about 45 minutes transcribed. Other ICSI research groups will also record additional meetings. There was a suggestion to collect multi-channel data in collaboration with local media broadcasters, potentially even recording events live from ICSI.

Adding more data from Meeting Recorder digits was proposed as a way to gain further insights. PhD B proposed using a smaller capacitor to address reverberation and expressed interest in the cutoff frequency to minimize interference with speech. The presented Bayes-net model incorporates inputs from various models and outputs posterior probabilities for decision nodes such as \"Go-there,\" \"EVA,\" \"Info-on,\" \"Location,\" and \"Timing.\" The XML format was used to present the input and output node structure, which already has many set value probabilities.

These machines work by identifying an optimal separating plane, which is more efficient compared to the computationally expensive k-means clustering method. The team expressed concerns about the potential combinatorial input that would arise from different linguistic and contextual schemas when using the Bayes net. To address this, the Professor suggested narrowing down the decision variables by studying the trade-offs between different input factors. One idea proposed by the team was to limit the types of objects in the environment to a small subset and establish rules governing actions related to those objects. Speaker mn014 conducted training to enable the system to distinguish between speech from loud and quiet speakers. This pre-segmentation modification allows for the specification of desired minimum lengths for speech and silence portions, as well as facilitating the identification of pauses and utterance boundaries."

However, it was recognized that audible breaths are an important aspect of recorded speech and should not be removed from the corpus. Speaker mn005 will present his findings on detecting speaker overlap in the next meeting. In densely populated sections of speaker overlap, transcribers are likely to overlook backchannels, which also poses a challenge for automatic speech and non-speech detection. Speaker mn014 highlighted the issue of short and not loud enough backchannels being overlooked.

Grad A explained that his vector contained binary values indicating the existence of phonological features, with the goal of mapping feature sets to the presence of specific phonological features. The focus at the moment was on feature detection rather than mapping. Future efforts would involve obtaining accurate forced alignments on digit data and generating a report for Eurospeech'01. PhD B's model performed better on high mismatch cases, reflecting the team's priority in that area.

They found that the similarity between different languages would allow them to cover more ground with fewer languages. However, the recognizer faced challenges when dealing with segments labeled as 'overlap', where multiple speakers were talking at the same time. It performed well on segments labeled as 'non-overlap', where only one person was talking.

The team also discussed VTS techniques. Initially, the professor did not see the advantage of combining the Wiener filter and the subspace, but later realized that a simple spectral subtraction, followed by a KL transform and a Wiener filter, would suffice. The log magnitude spectral subtraction utilized twelve seconds from the past and future to calculate the mean. The use of a short window did not significantly impact the model's performance, which was desirable. The team also removed silence to enhance the model's effectiveness, drawing a parallel to caching utterances.

PhD I suggested re-evaluating recognition methods without cheating on the segmentation and explained the use of recognizer alignments for training the speech detector, which may require hand labeling for data generation. Postdoc E advocated for proficient English speakers to ensure a stable language model, regardless of accent, as long as they can effectively follow English grammar. The revised semantic specification and construction formalism offer greater stability compared to previous versions, incorporating construction types, meaning types, and formal considerations such as verb subcategorization. The semantic specification is divided into three levels: \"scenario\" describes the current event using Source-Path-Goal, Container, etc.; \"referent\" includes grammatical information and ontology references for discourse entities; and \"discourse segment\" encompasses utterance-specific elements."

The professor believed that the team's intuition was guiding them towards statistically characterizing what was missing from the spectral envelope, including things potentially lost in the smoothing process. In discussing the corpus, the team debated the extent of segmentation and which recordings to include, expressing the need to filter out breath and non-verbal sounds. They also considered creating a separate directory for two-person conversations and transcripts that deviated from the general meeting setup. While some systems in Aurora performed poorly, the Alcatel systems showed better results, although the Danish model did not improve overall.

The idea of professionally pressed discs was considered, but the decision was made against it due to the need for in-house burning and the requirement to re-burn the CDs annually. The students explored different computation methods for combining influences mathematically, such as weighted combination and mixture of experts, but no consensus was reached on which method to apply in belief-nets. The computer navigation system experiment involved the subject familiarizing themselves with city information, using an advanced navigation system to complete tasks like buying stamps.

The recordings were generally clean. The team recognized the need for rewiring to ensure a stable power supply and prevent accidental unplugging of equipment. They proposed building a cabinet to consolidate cables and minimize clutter. The group discussed the possibility of conducting detailed acoustic-phonetic analyses on a subset of digits or Switchboard data. It was suggested that data-driven methods should be preceded by knowledge-driven approaches to incorporate sub-phonemic features into the data, either manually or using a comprehensive pronunciation dictionary. A new version of the pre-segmentation tool, capable of segmenting speech and non-speech portions specific to each channel, was developed and tested. Grad C introduced the concept of allowing subjects to generate high-level tasks, such as shopping, independently. Subjects would be provided with a high-level schematic outlining basic environmental features, while detailed information, like street maps, would be reserved for interactions with a wizard. An instructor would be hired to assist subjects in navigating these high-level tasks."

During the meeting, a significant portion of time was dedicated to the presentation of the PRM of the proposed system. The team has been working on integrating various techniques into a single software, achieving a score of 53.6. They have focused on spectral subtraction and noise addition after cleaning up mel bins. However, the professor expressed that he did not believe much had changed. The team discussed the size of the neural net, which is currently a simple net with 27 outputs. The professor recommended using a larger net with more features. They also explored the potential impact of removing silent frames on the model. The professor suggested incorporating a bigger hidden layer, although he did not anticipate a significant improvement in performance due to computational limitations. The deployed model has generally reduced error rates, but the effectiveness varies depending on the language and deployment location. They discovered that similar projects faced similar challenges. However, the model is not efficient and consumes excessive CPU and memory for the benefits it provides. The professor conveyed his suggestions through stories, emphasizing the importance of conducting experiments to measure the impact of different features while considering variance.

Formalization and notation are being worked on by another team, while student research is expected to bring forth more ideas. The participants were skeptical about considering a two-person conversation in the hallway as a meeting, suggesting that it should be separated in the corpus for future researchers. The professor strongly believed that these interactions did not qualify as meetings. The team discussed generating queries and considered directly generating them from the summaries, although concerns were raised about desirability.

To achieve this, the expansion of the Ontology and Discourse nodes will begin by working with a simple construction, such as \"where is X?\". By analyzing this basic utterance, the limits of the information derived from the construction can be determined, and the module can be designed to accommodate other constructions. In order to address mental spaces and context issues (such as time and space), mechanisms will be employed to create interconnected spaces with defined rules of interaction.

They also noted that the pre-segmentation tool does not perform well on short utterances like backchannels. The team acknowledged the limitations of the VAD (Voice Activity Detection) due to insufficient baseline features and considered using MFCC (Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients) instead, although optimizing for one would result in lower scores on the other. Despite this, the overall model performance had improved with lower latencies. The VAD neural net had twelve times nine inputs and two outputs, and although it introduced some latency, it could potentially be run in parallel. One team member, Postdoc A, purchased new earphones from Cambridge SoundWorks to address the issue of low gain in the original headphones. Professor D mentioned that they would be acquiring another disk rack with four thirty-six gigabyte disks to increase storage space, and there were plans to relocate the directories of Aurora data, Carmen's Data, and SPINE.

Interestingly, the performance of short filters was on par with long filters, and the model showed promise in well-matched cases. Despite mixed results, the shorter latency was seen as a positive indicator. On the other hand, the best results were achieved when applying FFT bins with a Wiener filter and no noise addition, although the results with noise were still close. It was noted that most nets were not as good, except for the multi English.

During the trial run of the interface, Litonya served as the first subject, with Fey acting as the wizard. The team was pleased with Fey's performance and decided to hire her. Based on Fey's suggestion, they also agreed to introduce the wizard in a more appropriate manner. Furthermore, the team acknowledged that the run was too long, lasting 5 minutes. PhD B conducted an experiment to enhance the backend performance of the Aurora recognizer, focusing on the recognition of the HTK system and challenging the canonical paradigm. Specifically, PhD B concentrated on Italian and experimented with the number of states for different words, believing that training for each case could improve performance by accounting for variance differences. The Professor considered the experiments to be relatively simple, so computational power was not a concern. Additionally, he proposed increasing the number of states from six to nine.

However, PhD C expressed skepticism about the artificial nature of the variance, as it relied on canonical mappings from TIMIT labelings. While derivatives were not discussed with Jose, alternative approaches were explored, including log energy compression and assessing different temporal sizes. Jose is experimenting with varying the temporal size over two hundred milliseconds and considering the use of moving windows, as previously discussed, with measurements at the frame level. One challenge identified is the lack of a channel identifier to aid in encoding speaker overlaps, particularly when speech is uttered while laughing, posing difficulties for ASR. Speaker mn005's attempts to detect speaker overlap have been unsuccessful thus far, as energy normalization has proven unreliable as an indicator of overlap. The preparation of files for transcription by IBM is encountering minor difficulties due to features such as hand-coded time boundaries and multiple channels, which may complicate the generation of beep files."

Grad E initiated the conversation by introducing a model developed by Saul, Allen, and Rahim, which utilizes independent tests to detect phonetic features. It was explained that using multiple detectors trained on different features provides greater robustness compared to a full-band of Gaussian mixtures. To facilitate the transcription process, transcribers will be provided with channelized data that has already been segmented for speech/non-speech boundaries. Additionally, efforts will be made to correctly re-classify breathy channels, which are currently mislabeled as speech, using alternative methods."

They also explored the possibility of clustering these features to enhance the model's robustness. The team utilized OGI features, a contextualized KLT, an MLP, and a low-pass filter, but encountered difficulties with the Italian part. Attempts to improve performance through silence detection yielded unsatisfactory results. To address the issue of combinatorial explosion in setting probabilities, the team employed Noisy-OR's, which simplified probability tables and applied a deterministic function. Formalized transcription checking procedures included spell checks, exhaustive lists of identified forms, attribution of utterances to appropriate speaker IDs, glossing spoken forms with their orthographic counterparts, transcribing acronyms, and encoding comments.

Professor D agreed that the LDA filter was interesting and suggested using hamming as well. Professor G mentioned that most people use online filtering, which involves subtracting the mean rather than using LDA. To gather diverse meeting data, the team proposed collecting data with variations in mic placement, speaker sound overlap, style, and dominance relationships. Some members also suggested gathering TV and radio data. A detailed diagram of the EVA belief-net was presented, highlighting key features and properties such as \"Go-there\" (binary), \"timing\" (current/next tour), \"reason\" (business, sight-seeing, socializing), \"transport\", \"length of tour\", \"costs\", and \"entity\" (open, accessible). The next step involves refining the set of feature nodes and identifying possible clusters.

The professor informed the group that the current neural network utilized a sigmoid with a weighted sum as a low-level detector, trained using gradient descent. He suggested further exploration of this topic on Friday. Speaker C's use of an HMM-based detector with Gaussian mixtures has resulted in pre-segmentations that aid in transcription. In the construction \"Where is X?\", the ambiguity between location and path could be addressed through either semantic coding or contextual determination. The former approach would require creating different constructions for slight pragmatic variations, while the latter could involve instantiating belief-net probabilities in the lexicon."
