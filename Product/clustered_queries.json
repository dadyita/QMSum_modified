In User Interface's words, it would be more like a traditional remote control. Second, the team reached a consensus that the design of double curves shall be changed into a single curve since it was the biggest expense there.

But then they found out that the primary cost drivers were 10 buttons for program numbers. To get rid of them, Project Manager boldly proposed replacing them with a scroll-wheel, which was finally accepted despite disputes over its unfriendly nature for elderly users.

This type of material was made up of specific alloys of metals which have a shape memory, and it also allowed recycling. Hence, the product manager lifted out the point that the company could recycle the old remote controls from customers and take down the usable parts to make new remote controls.

Plus, many people today were television surfers, and the scroll was a great mechanism for surfing. But there were two problems with the scroll wheel.

However, the function that enabled the user to design for its own front look stood out since this could add value to users' favour towards personalities. The team also came to an agreement that the remote control's relevant buttons were prominently visible and relevant to each other, making the device easy to use.

The industrial designer suggested using wood instead of plastic to make the controller more fashionable and having buttons with LCD so that people could see the controller in dark. In terms of the alimentation, it would be good to have both the classical battery and solar energy alimentation. Considering that the product was supposed to be easy to use, the industrial designer thought some low level chip would be enough, which was agreed by the group."

            "answer": "The prototype should be shown to people of various age and socio-economic groups to see if there should be any fine-tuning. Also, it should be shown to consumer research groups for feedback. Marketing concluded that the prototype reached the goal of being biomorphic, soft and compact with bright and warm colours and felt good in hands. All in all, Marketing believed that it was a great product and would be saleable in the market."

And another thing Marketing found important was that users had a feeling for speech recognition so that they could choose channels by voice. And they wanted maybe an LCD screen to search what's on every channel."

For the case, it would be double curved and made of rubber. The interface was push buttons and they would be in special colours and forms. Considering the cost of the above materials, the remote would be within budget as it cost ten seventy euros a unit."

However, Project Manager reckoned that the Bluetooth function means that users  need a television that has Bluetooth function. Televisions rarely have this function. Marketing thought that it would be a new trend and they need to move away from what they already had and go creative. But after all the proposal of Bluetooth was suspended."

Moreover, the team agreed to discard the joystick but keep the LCD and advance chips,to make it still favored by the young market.

Secondly, one chip was enough and they were going to choose one from different types of regular chips. However, as the team found out they could incorporate more valuable components, the team decided to use one advanced chip for now. In terms of the material used on the device, the team decided to use a combination of rubber and plastic with one small part used in one special materia, like titanium, as well as a special color. Moreover, the teletext was discarded and the docking station was added. As for the infrared LED, although it was originally presented on Marketing's powerpoint, the team agreed that it was not helpful. Later, the team found that regular chips were enough for the scroll-button and only the LCD display required the advanced ones, so again the team came back for the regular chip and cut some costs. In the end, the team incorporated solar cells for the battery."

Then the industrial designer replied that the function of programming the keys was affordable while the feasibility of the ASR system was uncertain. Therefore, maybe they should make some compromise. Finally, the industrial designer and the user interface designer were required to provide two designs with the exact cost price at the next meeting so that they could see which one fit their budget better."

To cut costs, the Project Manager first suggested using normal chips only in exchange for the speech recognition function. The special color was left to the case and it was designed as curved on the sides and curved on the top and bottom as well. Later, the team had argued a lot whether to eliminate the number of buttons or to discard LCD displays. However, if the number of buttons were to be eliminated, it would be far more complicated to use the device, since users must press one button several times to get to the channel. After a vote and discussion about the cost, the team decided to discard both the LCD display and the speech recognition functions since they were really expensive and the later one could not work without the existence of the former one."

Project Manager proposed that the handle could make it more stable, but lost the features of the sphere; in the design of the joystick keyboard, Marketing also wanted to use hinges to make the keyboard remote control more portable.
