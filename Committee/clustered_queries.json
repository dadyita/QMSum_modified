However, she explained that the Act was built on what were the quality assessment arrangements in the 1992 Act, which required HEFCW to secure arrangements for the assessment of the quality of education provided by funding institutions. So, as a consequence of that approach, HEFCW's quality assessment duty currently encompassesed all the education provided by or on behalf of a regulated institution. Huw Morris also helped to explain that a lot of joint operation was required during the process and the new Bill would try to make that clearer."

For example, in England, despite higher financial incentives to join ITE courses, people still were not getting onto those courses. To solve this problem, they had taken several steps including making sure their ITE provision was world class, embarking on the first national ITE recruitment marketing exercise, etc. In this process, Llyr Gruffydd had a doubt that the level of ambition did not reflect the level of action that was needed actually. Kirsty Williams responded that different statistics told different stories.

The quality of the research base in Welsh universities and the productivity of that Welsh research base are both good, there's just not enough of them. If they want to be able to play into the UK-wide research funding, the investment has two dimensions. One is having enough researchers playing in larger projects rather than small-scale projects; and the second thing is that, compared to UK-wide research pots, Wales' core research funding is not competitive.

Second, current uncertainty also came as a result of the political environment like the Augar review in England and Brexit. This might deepen the funding gap.

We can also see some changes in students' applications and in increasing difficulties of the EU collaborative research activities. In terms of the financial impact, if it is accepted that the UK is a net contributor to the EU then, presumably, some of Wales' money will go straight into politics, and the benefits are unknown, which will become a matter of politics. In terms of recruitment, both European Union-domiciled applicants to Wales and non-EU international students decreased, who applied to Welsh institutions.

Wales' institutions' fee level is slightly lower, but they do struggle in terms of the Anglocentric nature of the media and so on. The other dimension is about the attractiveness of the higher institutions in a highly competitive recruitment market. Wales universities don't have enough investment in facilities, and particularly buildings and kits."

He exemplified some of them: the eagerness to adjust to the English system, the nature of the offer (the combination of the A-Levels that institution offered), etc. In conclusion, Kirsty Williams believed that no effective evidence could demonstrate that the avoidance of the baccalaureate was the sole driver for the students choices to move to other areas."

The second question was about whether there was a risk that those in education settings would have a key role in referring more parents to social services, which could cause potential harm to relationships and cause mistrust. Alastair Birch disagreed that this was a matter of mistrust. He thought if a professional believed there was significant harm to that child, they were under a duty to report that to social care."

These two bills alone pushed over $200 billion of investment out of Canada, causing the Alberta economy to retract to recession levels.

Basically, they relied on the school categorization system. What's more, in Kirsty's opinion, the school improvement service was a risk-based approach. Luckily, the categorization system on which they depended would continue to evolve to align itself to the curriculum reform and make changes in self-evaluation. It would continue to evolve because it had to be consistent with their overall approach to school improvement and raising standards.

Sometimes it was hard to make a final judgment since the futures of the students were unpredictable but the fee and access plans could always be one of the drivers for some of the improvements. In the meantime, constant efforts had been put into communications with  a range of stakeholders to continue developing legislative proposals to assure the fee."

Therefore, they would expect them to expect those sChools to apply the same principle.

In the nature of the cohort, there are more children subject to free school meals than are subject to being looked after.

The government was content with the fact that the governance machinery within the institutions was structured appropriately and if the universities would like to engage any other things than trivial borrowing, they need to get the government consent as well.

Sally Jenkins responded that those drivers in relation to that awareness raising should be the key. There were a lot of ways for this including preventative services, universal services and etc. Then they had some discussions on whether the awareness raising should be on the face of the Bill and who should pay for this. Huw David was not sure whether being on the Bill was necessary, but he said it was worth consideration. Welsh Government Ministers should have a duty on this."

Investment would be spent on different sources and they should pay more attention to extending them.

One of the things that they've used PDG for is the focus on the concept of growth mindset in school, a universal thing that they've trained all the teachers in.  There are some other ways to drive the potential of talented and able children, like the example of \"a window on the world bus\" paid for by schools."

They can't force parents to divulge information that is a matter for them. But there is an active discussion going on at the moment about whether they could create a dataset where people divulge this information and we can then track the children through.

First, they were making sure that their ITE provision was world class, and recently they were through an accreditation process for a new ITE provision that would start in the next academic year. Second, they had looked at financial incentives.Third, they were embarking on their first national ITE recruitment marketing exercise. Kirsty Williams mentioned that this was not a unique issue in Wales, but a common issue across the globe. Money was not the only reason that prevented people from getting onto these courses. What's more, from next year, they would be going to have their unique part-time PGCE route into qualification, which allowed people to bring their outside world experience into teaching, and this could increase the diversity in their teaching workforce."

They thought for some students, accessibility was an issue, and that was why they were responding with their part-time PGCE route, which actually would be located neutral. Therefore, if geographical disadvantages were stopping somebody from pursuing a career aspiration to qualify as a teacher, the new part-time PGCE would allow them to do this."

However, his attitude had changed. As the locals usually did not take foreign students as immigrants, the government should treat the foreign students and those who came from EU as the same, which is to say, a new immigration system should be set to ensure that EU students and all the other foreign ones would receive the same treatment when seeking a job in Wales."

To tackle this issue, the government had provided funding in 2017-18 and 2018-19 to WISERD Education, which was a research collaboration between a number of the Welsh universities, specifically looking at educational issues.
