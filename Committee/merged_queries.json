How did Sian Gwenllian AM inquire about quality assurance and how did Kirsty Williams AM respond to her question?", "answer": "Sharon Davies expressed strong objection to the limitations imposed by home tuition, as it restricted the access of local authorities to families and made it difficult to ensure the quality of education. The role of local authorities in this aspect was therefore limited. Hefin David AM raised concerns about finding the right balance between highly regulated institutions with strong track records and riskier private alternative providers. Kirsty Williams AM argued that more attention should be given to the quality of charitable status as a reference point for operation, while differentiating between private providers in England. The government would regulate private providers on a course-by-course basis, with a focus on quality provision. Sian Gwenllian AM highlighted the difficulties caused by HEFCW's legal duty to quality-assure all provisions in two further education colleges, and sought clarification from Kirsty Williams AM on the situation and additional methods to ensure governing qualities. Kirsty Williams AM explained that the Act was based on the quality assessment arrangements in the 1992 Act, which required HEFCW to assess the quality of education provided by funding institutions. As a result, HEFCW's quality assessment duty currently covered all education provided by regulated institutions.

Currently, funding for Welsh institutions is at a lower level, and there is also a reduction in enrollments for both Welsh and English-domiciled applications. Additionally, there is uncertainty regarding potential consequences from the Augar review of fees and funding in England. One of the biggest issues is the lack of investment in the research base of Welsh universities, despite the good quality and productivity. To be competitive in UK-wide research funding, there needs to be more researchers involved in larger projects and a more focused approach to engaging with research councils. Dr. David Blaney highlighted three factors contributing to the current uncertainty: the demographic dip of 18-year-olds, increased pension costs, and the impact of political decisions such as the Augar review and Brexit. These factors may deepen the funding gap and pose challenges for universities in providing services under limited funding."}, "5": {"query": "What is Dr. David Blaney's opinion on the impact of Brexit on Wales' higher education system, including the drop in EU students applying to study in Wales and the reasons why prospective students should choose to study in Wales?", "answer": "The economic impact of Brexit on the higher education sector in Wales is evident in various ways, such as the reliance on income sources from the EU and the challenges faced in EU collaborative research activities. Additionally, there have been changes in student applications, with a decrease in both EU and non-EU international students applying to Welsh institutions, while the numbers for these groups have increased for English universities. The financial impact of Brexit raises concerns about Wales' contribution to EU politics and the unknown benefits that may result. Recruitment of students is also affected, with factors such as changes in student support arrangements for EU students and the lack of investment in facilities and infrastructure in Welsh universities playing a role.

She also committed to a high-intensity awareness-raising campaign if the Bill passed. However, she believed that amendments 1A to 1E, which focused on the duty to raise awareness, were unnecessary. She felt that the level of detail on the face of the Bill was not needed for amendments 1B, 1C, and 1D. The Deputy Minister believed that safeguarding was everyone's responsibility, making amendment 1C about raising concerns redundant. She requested support for amendments 1 and 4 and the rejection of amendments 1A to 1E.\n\nRegarding the post-implementation review, the Deputy Minister agreed on its importance and committed to including a duty for the review in a Government amendment. She opposed amendment 2C, which required a report on the effect of public awareness promotion before section 1 is commenced, as she believed it conflicted with the implementation priority.

Contingency plans were discussed, focusing on promotion and seeking additional funding sources, as well as strengthening Global Wales engagement. Infrastructure funding was also addressed, with collaboration between UK universities and arguments made at the UK Government level. The funding council in Wales was the first to have a memorandum of understanding with the National Union of Students, requiring all HE providers to have student charters for student protection. Further education institutions delivering higher education are also required to have similar protections. The government is supporting local companies for production, canceling contracts with those that do not meet Canadian standards. Multiple supply chains are being run simultaneously, and contracts are being signed with more domestic companies. However, the opposition party remains skeptical about the funding of these companies. The Prime Minister explained that the airline industry, like banking and telecommunications, falls under federal jurisdiction and can receive wage subsidies. The government is working to ensure equal distribution across the nation. Hon.

He also believed that there would be no cross-border issues resulting from this potential legislation, and that the proposed changes to CPS guidance would not assist scrutinisers in making decisions regarding Welsh law. Barry Hughes concluded that there were two main implications of the Bill. Firstly, it would raise awareness among English individuals who travel to Wales. Secondly, people from other regions might view this defense in a similar manner to how they viewed the drink driving limit in Scotland.

However, the success of any legislation depends on its implementation and the accompanying cultural change. The number of looked-after children in Wales is increasing due to severe neglect and abuse, and Huw David emphasized the importance of not losing focus on this issue. He acknowledged that there already existed legislation to protect children who are currently being assaulted and abused by their parents on a daily basis. However, the threshold for what constitutes abuse is unclear, and children may be led to believe that being smacked by their parents is acceptable. Huw David stressed the need to establish a clear line and viewed this as a step forward.

This means that every school will be required by law to teach mental health, as the \"what matters\" statements encompass both aspects. The government intends to ensure that these statements are universally implemented. However, there is concern that children aged 3-5 are often exposed to concepts prematurely, leading to negative impressions and a loss of confidence in the long run. The cost of training for teachers is expected to be minimal, as existing courses on childcare issues can absorb the necessary information. The Healthy Child Wales program and the role of health visitors are seen as crucial in providing a universal service.

He suggested that headmasters and local authorities should approach the new Act with a more constructive mindset, as it would be beneficial for the post-16 sector. Hopkins also expressed his belief that the delegation levels were sufficient in most authority areas, thanks to agreements with the government to ensure adequate funding for schools.

Ultimately, amendment 3A was rejected, and amendment 3 was agreed upon. Suzy Davies believed that what may seem like a technical issue to one person could be an essential part of the legislative procedure and an important aspect of scrutiny. She was pleased that amendment 8 had removed an order provision. Suzy Davies considered amendment 3A to be a probing amendment and not a separate commencement power.

Schools played a crucial role in supporting families, as they had established relationships with them. Alastair Birch, however, did not view this as a matter of mistrust. He stated that working with families involved obtaining parental consent, which was a key element. While some cases did not meet the referral threshold, support would still be provided by the school."}, "101": {"query": "Summarize the discussion on the efficacy of the law and how to clarify to parents that the legislation is not meant to criminalize them.", "answer": "Barry Hughes argued that children have fewer rights than adults, leading to the need for the law to protect them from physical assault. He suggested that the law should be updated to reflect the current social behavior. The discussion then shifted to the legal framework and its enforcement. The first stage involved assessing the evidence provided by the police to determine if there was a realistic chance of conviction. Only if this stage was satisfied, the second stage, which focused on the public interest, would be considered. Sally Jenkins emphasized the importance of collaboration with colleagues in education, social care, preventative services, as well as the Welsh Government and the National Assembly. She highlighted the various avenues for raising awareness, including preventative services, universal services, regional safeguarding boards, and national safeguarding boards. The goal was to raise awareness on a broader scale by utilizing all available channels."}, "102": {"query": "Summarize the discussion and outcomes of stakeholder workshops on early help and enhanced support.", "answer": "The Mental Health Measure in the UK experienced a significant increase in its target, leading to the implementation of a program that aimed to meet the demand through increased contacts, staff, and shorter access times. However, sustainability was not fully achieved at that stage. Despite this, there were commendable efforts in providing intervention resources. A stakeholder workshop was held, which successfully supported early help and enhanced support. In terms of legacy arrangements, the CAMHS element would be transferred to the CAMHS network, a part of the NHS mental health network. The workshop served as a platform for various agencies to come together and discuss their demands and interests. A planning group reflection took place for the next stage, resulting in three commitments. The first commitment involved the development of values-led approaches to foster collaboration among multiple agencies. The second commitment focused on identifying the ingredients for successful working.

While it was challenging to make final judgments due to the unpredictable futures of students, the fee and access plans could serve as drivers for improvements. Continuous efforts were being made to communicate with various stakeholders and develop legislative proposals to ensure the fee. Huw Irranca-Davies believed that \u00a34.50 was an appropriate and universal amount, and even low-income families could differentiate between providers. Transparency would be a key aspect, allowing parents to make informed decisions. New pilots in Cardiff and Newport were scheduled to begin in September to gather experiences from high-cost areas. If these areas showed higher rates, further discussions would be held with the committee. However, Huw Irranca-Davies stressed the importance of starting the project first before assuming a higher rate was necessary.

These schools are expected to apply the same principle of social distancing. It is unlikely that a child in a special school would be placed in a different setting, given the nature of the school. The focus of awareness regarding the Pupil Development Grant (PDG) is mainly on free school meals, with less awareness about its availability to support looked-after children. The number of children receiving free school meals is higher than the number of looked-after children. The intention behind this allocation is to strategically deploy resources and have a greater impact. The PDG for looked-after children is managed at a regional level."}, "105": {"query": "What were the government's plans and policies regarding structural change and the university's estates strategy?", "answer": "Angela Burns AM raised concerns about the consistency of funding based on feedback from students. Dr. David Blaney emphasized the legal obligation to meet commitments and the importance of prioritizing student interests. He clarified that the current structural changes would not necessarily result in the closure of certain divisions or offshoots, as oversight and monitoring were focused on student welfare. However, he stressed the need for a suitable solution to avoid causing material uncertainty for students. Dr. Blaney also highlighted the proper governance oversight in place for institutions, with estates strategies overseen by governing bodies or relevant sub-committees. The government was satisfied with the governance machinery within institutions and required their consent for any non-trivial borrowing. To ensure universities did not default on loans, the government implemented close monitoring of borrowing changes and ongoing monitoring."}, "106": {"query": "What is the group's opinion on the EAS consortium's approach to using the looked-after and adopted PDG as part of a broader strategy for vulnerable learners? Additionally, what is the group's perspective on the high exclusion rates among looked-after children, who are over six times more likely to receive a fixed-term exclusion?", "answer": "The focus is on ensuring the success of all learners, especially the most vulnerable ones. There is a growing awareness of attachment disorder in children and the need for schools to respond effectively. The goal is to provide better training for teachers, improve understanding, and implement intervention strategies. This approach is being implemented in four regions. It is important to consider exclusions and understand the entire education system, not just the PDG element. 66% of looked-after learners have additional learning needs, so funding cannot be solely attributed to the PDG."}, "107": {"query": "What are the potential difficulties for researcher collaborations and networks after Brexit? How does the loss of funds due to leaving the European Union impact these collaborations and what are the possible solutions?", "answer": "The impact of the Brexit deal on collaborations is still uncertain, particularly in relation to playing a role in Horizon Europe. Maintaining quality, impact, and growth in capacity is crucial for Wales. Dr. David Blaney believes that these efforts have already yielded positive results, such as increased research funding and a stronger presence in the international research market. However, the main challenge lies in securing sufficient funding. While the government recently allocated an additional \u00a36.6 million for research, this is not sustainable or adequate.

Secondary school pupils often feel neglected and it is challenging for schools to provide effective support. During extended closures, it is important for school staff to check in with students through phone or video calls to maintain contact. It is also crucial to promote online resources such as the Meic website to engage young people."}, "110": {"query": "What is the group's opinion on the existing problem of Erasmus and the mobility funding for students? Additionally, what is their stance on the question of whether students should be refunded some of their tuition fees?", "answer": "Replacing the well-established and long-term Erasmus program would be a challenge, as implementing a similar program would be less efficient and more costly. Seven universities are incorporating elements of mobility into their own income and fees, but it would not be as effective as Erasmus. Huw suggests that lessons should be learned from established quality assurance and enhancement procedures in institutions to ensure that the material meets the needs of tutors and supporters. The intention in all institutions is for students to complete their course of study, and they are confident in the robustness of the system to meet their learning needs."}, "111": {"query": "Summarize the discussion on the priority for vulnerable children, adequate social support for children in foster care, and the implementation of social services.", "answer": "The group emphasized the importance of providing adequate social support to vulnerable children during the pandemic to protect them from infection and other physical and mental health issues. Despite the awkward situation, they were relieved to find that there were enough staff available to offer mental support to these children. Another key concern was ensuring a safe living environment for children in foster care. The group had been working closely with fostering organizations in Welsh, and they were pleased to discover that these organizations were running smoothly with sufficient staff and resources to provide excellent care for the children. Additionally, the fostering organizations extended their helpline hours to handle any emergencies that may arise. The group also discussed support measures such as a fund for foster carers, which would be further explored. It was clarified that the focus of their intervention was on short-term involvement with families, aiming to work with them and their family members to find their own solutions.

In response, the minister acknowledged the unique challenges faced by seniors and individuals with disabilities in long-term care facilities. The severity of the issue prompted the federal government to share a report with the Province of Ontario, which has initiated an investigation based on the findings. The leader of the opposition party questioned the existence of race-based or discriminatory police practices across Canada, to which the minister reassured that such practices do not exist in the police system. The opposition party also highlighted the inadequate long-term care facilities in Canada, which the minister acknowledged as a matter of utmost concern and urgency. Additionally, the opposition party expressed concerns about the vulnerability of Canadian workers and the insufficiency of changes made to bankruptcy insolvency laws. The minister emphasized their commitment to protecting workers' and pensioners' livelihoods. Hon. Lawrence MacAulay emphasized the importance of open discussion and appropriate compensation, as it represents democracy. The Minister of Seniors acknowledged the great need among seniors and explained that those receiving OAS and GIS payments are receiving $200 and $300 respectively, emphasizing that this is not an insignificant amount.

However, Llyr Gruffydd AM raised concerns about research showing some blurring in the implementation. Meilyr Rowlands acknowledged that schools may not follow the exact process but assured that the spirit of the PDG was included. Michelle Brown AM pointed out that only two-thirds of schools were effectively using the PDG, suggesting that better leadership, improved attendance, extra-curricular activities, and support for literacy and numeracy would engage learners. Estyn identified that most schools are using the PDG effectively, transitioning from investing in infrastructure to actual teaching and learning. Regional PDG advisers have been appointed to optimize fund deployment. Kirsty Williams emphasized the importance of tracking performance and the initial investment in PDG to establish tracking systems in schools.

The Canadian economy faced significant challenges. Cathy McLeod highlighted the struggles of the forestry industry, with plant closures and unemployment, while other industries received government support. Ministers acknowledged the need for solutions, including investment and industrial revolution. Mona Fortier, the Minister of Middle-Class Prosperity and Associate Minister of Finance, emphasized the government's financial support for over 2.5 million jobs and pledged continued support for industries, workers, and all Canadians, along with transparent revenue reporting.

The government has recognized the significant contribution of small businesses, which make up 98% of all businesses in the country. Measures such as the Canada emergency business account have been implemented to provide support to over 550,000 small businesses. The government is also taking steps to support small businesses with rent assistance, encouraging landlords to participate and working with provincial finance ministers to enforce the program. The fish and seafood sector has been severely impacted by COVID-19, and measures have been put in place to address their specific needs, including $62.5 million for processors and access to the CERB for seasonal workers and those who have exhausted their fishery EI.

Dr David Blaney explained that the lack of increase was due to financial constraints and obligations to other parts of the higher education system. While the importance of investing in QR research funding was acknowledged, the current capacity did not allow for this ambition. Kirsty mentioned the potential for local authorities to staff and choose locations for centers, with a focus on providing valuable services for children. No formal decision had been made, as the organizations needed to adapt to unprecedented circumstances without undermining their ability to provide youth services in the future. The government had been working with provinces and territories to provide a forgivable loan to commercial property owners, who would then lower rent for their tenants. The group emphasized the need for additional funding for universities, a new immigration policy, and seeking the minister's help to address the problem at an official level. Adequate funding would support research needs, a robust immigration policy would attract individuals to Wales, and raising awareness with the minister would bring the problem to national discussions."}, "118": {"query": "Summarize the discussions on awareness raising, evaluation, investment, responsibility, and the dataset on tracking adopted children. What were the accusations against the Prime Minister and the Government? How do the experts consider the appropriateness of the targeted money?", "answer": "The legislation aims to clarify that it does not intend to criminalize parents, and the responsibility for raising awareness on this matter was discussed. Sally Jenkins suggested that drivers should play a key role in raising awareness through various means such as preventative and universal services. The question of whether this awareness should be included in the Bill and who should bear the cost was also debated. Huw David expressed uncertainty about including it in the Bill but acknowledged its worth considering. It was agreed that Welsh Government Ministers should have a duty in this regard. The liberal government was criticized for limiting scrutiny of their spending and avoiding accountability by locking down Parliament.

To address this issue, several measures were being taken, including ensuring world-class ITE provision, undergoing an accreditation process for a new ITE provision, exploring financial incentives, and embarking on a national ITE recruitment marketing exercise. Kirsty Williams highlighted that this was not a unique issue in Wales but a global one, where money was not the sole deterrent for people to join these courses. Additionally, a unique part-time PGCE route was being introduced to increase diversity in the teaching workforce by allowing individuals to bring their outside world experience into teaching. Kirsty Williams stated that commenting on the independent process would not be appropriate, but the University of South Wales had a responsibility to support and provide appropriate tuition for students already in the system. The geographic spread of provision was discussed, with Kirsty Williams acknowledging the accessibility challenges faced by some students and introducing the part-time PGCE route as a neutral location option.

Kirsty Williams also highlighted that non-EU international students make up a significant portion of non-UK students in Wales institutions, suggesting that there is no need to be overly concerned about the current number of applications. Kirsty Williams praised Swansea University as a good example for other institutions to learn from, citing their attractive curriculum, desired courses, effective teaching, and appealing infrastructure as factors that successfully attract potential applicants. Julie Morgan mentioned that Wales universities were funded with 6.4 million dollars in 2017-18, and Kirsty Williams added that additional resources of \u00a35 million were made available to mitigate the freeze in tuition fees and kick-start postgraduate support. With adequate funding, Kirsty Williams believed that the fiscal problems of Wales universities would be alleviated.

It was emphasized that any assurance regime should adhere to coherent, effective, and comprehensive principles. Additionally, the quality framework should encompass higher education to align with ENQA, ensuring compatibility with UK-wide baseline standards and avoiding issues specific to the HE sector in Wales. While this may cause some controversy, it is necessary to adapt to the new situation. Huw Morris suggested promoting greater synergy in the approaches to quality assurance and enhancement across different areas of activity. Bethan Owen highlighted the importance of maintaining the appeal of Welsh universities to students and advocated for increased investment in the research portfolio, which would also yield economic benefits. In terms of decisions regarding the return of students to school, several factors must be considered: the safety and well-being of students and staff, alignment with the wider Welsh Government response to the pandemic, effective communication with parents and staff, and the needs of specific groups of children. Adequate workforce availability and addressing challenges related to social distancing and school transport are also crucial. Janet Finch-Saunders AM inquired about the grading of A-level and GCSE exams, and Kirsty Williams AM explained that canceling the exam series was the only clear decision, despite its devastating impact on students and teachers. The grading process involves teachers submitting the grades they believe students would have achieved, supported by a range of data and professional judgment. This data is then moderated by Qualifications Wales. Kirsty Williams also addressed concerns about Initial Teacher Education (ITE) scores, acknowledging that the statistics can be interpreted differently.

They also acknowledged the importance of having the complete package of resources available before teaching begins. Bethan Owen highlighted the disparity in research funding between Wales and England, with Welsh universities receiving less money due to a lower percentage of QR. To address this, the government provided funding to WISERD Education, a research collaboration among Welsh universities. However, the allocation for 2019-20 was still uncertain. The discussion on ministerial questions covered topics such as economic updates, federal support for provinces, and systemic racism. Hon. Chrystia Freeland acknowledged the existence of systemic racism in all federal institutions in Canada.
