  "172": "The user interface designer suggested a function where users can start a program and input their favorite channels by pressing a button, which was well-received by the project manager and marketing team as a potential market tool. The project manager believed the cost would be manageable through partnerships, while marketing argued that the technology was already available through their own service. This function would require a mode switch and an indicator. Marketing proposed designing a remote control specifically for television, while the user interface designer suggested adding buttons for playing, recording, and stopping on video recorders, although unsure of the technological feasibility. The industrial designer agreed that a simpler remote control for television would benefit older or less coordinated users. The initial working design of the remote control was presented, with a focus on user-friendliness and clear buttons. The project manager emphasized that teletext should be given less attention as it was outdated, and the target customers should be forty-plus, incorporating the corporate color and slogan. The remote control should only work with TV, with basic functions such as volume, channel, and one to two-digit numbers. The user interface proposed a stand-alone remote control with unique features, while the project manager suggested adding more useful functions like changing faces. Marketing suggested making the remote control functional for other devices as well. There was a disagreement between the project manager and industrial designer regarding the removal of the kinetic function, with the designer seeing it as a cool marketing promotion. To maintain the price level, they decided to adapt the control into a flat design to minimize costs.",
  "36": "The company recommends incorporating its corporate colours and design into the product, including the option for different colours such as pink or banana yellow and fun shapes like animals. The idea of using buttons with various shapes, such as a triangle for volume and square for channels, was also considered. It was agreed upon that the text on the remote should be clear and the remote itself should be compact. In terms of material, the group discussed the challenge of balancing budget and quality. To save costs while ensuring a satisfying user experience, the Project Manager decided to use high-quality recycled plastic. However, when it came to the battery, the Project Manager was willing to invest in a cutting-edge lithium battery. The company's slogan and design target revolve around incorporating fashion into electronics. While the idea of providing user-customizable skins was rejected due to the amount of work involved, the members were inspired to add the company logo on the boot-up screen and introduce a dormant mode to prevent the remote from flashing when the TV is on. There were two main reasons behind these design choices. Firstly, the relatively high unit price of each remote control (twenty-five Euros) necessitated the inclusion of satisfying and high-quality features to justify the cost. Secondly, the presence of competition in the market meant that the new TV remote controls needed to be special and different in order to attract customers.",
  "50": "The team brainstormed several potential product names, such as \"banana\", \"RC deluxe\", \"real reactor\", and \"triple RC\". After careful consideration, they focused on refining the name \"triple RC\" and ultimately settled on \"triple R\". The group found this name to be cool, especially when printed on the front, and catchy. They unanimously agreed to eliminate \"banana remote\" and \"the deluxe\" from the options, as they all favored \"triple R\" for its cool appearance when printed. Additionally, they discussed incorporating the company's logo and color into the product design, although it didn't necessarily have to be the exact same color. While no specific color or logo had been decided, the industrial designer suggested yellow as a potential color, which was ultimately adopted.",
  "35": "The team conducted a comprehensive evaluation of the remote control design, rating the shape and color with a unanimous score of one on a scale of one to seven. The size received mixed ratings, with Marketing giving it a four, the Project Manager a two, and the others a one. In terms of feel, including texture and comfort, User Interface scored it a three, while the rest gave it a two. Functionality received a two from User Interface and Marketing, and a three from the others. Overall, the team expressed satisfaction with the product. To further assess the design, Marketing proposed a rating system based on three aspects: fanciness, technological innovation, and ease of use. The remote control received scores of three, two, and four in these respective areas, indicating its acceptability. Additionally, Marketing suggested evaluating the project's feasibility and whether the product met their requirements. The design was judged on a scale of one to seven, with criteria including fanciness, technology, robustness, usefulness, size and weight, color and shape, and adaptiveness. The product received an average score of 2.17, indicating its quality.",
  "150": "The User Interface team presented the various aspects of the remote control, including its function, customizability, and appearance in terms of color, material, and shape. The group then discussed the placement of the microphone, as well as the weight and shape of the buttons. The Project Manager suggested that the microphone should be located under the flip, while the User Interface team argued for it to be on the side. Additionally, the User Interface team proposed that the buttons should be made in the shape of an egg and be made of plasticine. However, there was disagreement between the Project Manager and the User Interface team regarding the location of the microphone. The Project Manager believed that the microphone should be under the flip to allow users to easily turn off the voice recognition, while the User Interface team insisted that the microphone should be on the side to enable voice activation even when the remote control is out of reach.",
  "136": "The team had mixed opinions about the Project Manager's leadership. While the Project Manager himself felt that his leadership was lacking, the Industrial Designer believed that he provided clear direction on when to start and end tasks, which was crucial for effective leadership. The User Interface team thought that the Project Manager did a good job because they had a democratic process with no set roles. The Marketing team also felt that the team worked well together. Overall, the team agreed that the Project Manager did a good job, and this sentiment was echoed by the other team members. During the meeting, the team used a whiteboard, but they felt that they could have utilized it more. They mostly relied on slides because they were better positioned. However, the User Interface team pointed out that not all team members had enough experience with leadership to provide a fair assessment.",
  "140": "The team considered using titanium for the device but found it to be expensive, easily dented, and limited in shape options. They decided to use plastic instead, which could be molded into different curved shapes. Marketing suggested using a plastic mold with a rubber cover to give the device a spongy feel and allow for easy customization. The Industrial Designer, User Interface, and Project Manager all agreed on this idea. For the touch screen, there were two options: a bare PCB circuit board in different colors that could be operated by touch, or anti RSI rubber buttons with an LCD screen. The Industrial Designer expressed concerns about the LCD screen being only black and white and the difficulty of distinguishing where to press on the bare PCB circuit board. The team decided to use the chip TA11835 and PCB board in the device, and they agreed on using kinetic charging and a standby mode to save battery. The device case would be made of plastic with a changeable rubber cover, and LCD screens would be incorporated. The idea of adding a stylus or a mirror to the device was rejected.",
  "158": "The User Interface team emphasized the importance of adjusting the design of the remote control to meet the needs of users, focusing on a user-centered approach that reduces buttons and improves usability. They suggested halting research on the general remote controller proposed by marketing, as it would increase the budget and button count, and instead focusing on the appearance design. The Industrial Designer highlighted the primary function of the remote control as sending messages to another system, requiring an energy source for the integrated circuit and a chip to control the infrared lamp. They proposed making the battery and infrared lamp more affordable and sustainable, and incorporating a speech recognition interface based on market research. The market research revealed that users' biggest frustration was losing the remote control in their homes. To address this issue, the Industrial Designer suggested adding a button on the TV that, when pressed, would make the remote control beep to help locate it. This solution was deemed feasible within the budget. Additionally, the Industrial Designer drew inspiration from the design of Xbox and emphasized the importance of considering the physical differences among users worldwide when determining the size of the remote control, citing the example of Japanese people with smaller hands.",
  "0": "The ideal remote control, according to Marketing, should combine 3-4 different controllers into a thin device that allows users to switch between them by sliding or flipping. The Industrial Designer suggested a two-sided controller, with one side kept simple and the other side more complex. User Interface summarized the prototype, which should be curved, easy to hold, small, and have big buttons, including a scroll and push buttons. The body of the remote control should be made of smooth plastic or spongy rubber, with yellow and black buttons. It should also have a suitable curvature for comfortable viewing and the on-off switch at the back. The detailed design consisted of a presentation by the Industrial Designer on the wheel, button, and base of the remote control, as well as a presentation by Marketing on eleven evaluation criteria based on marketing trend reports and company strategy. The group also discussed various designing requirements, including adaptability to multiple devices with few buttons, the ability to be lit in the dark and held in hand, and being water-proof and shock-proof. Additionally, a whistle tracking system was proposed to gain an advantage over competitors, despite the potential increase in production cost.",
  "161": "The User Interface Designer and the Project Manager had differing opinions on the placement of the screen on the product. The User Interface Designer believed it should be in the middle, while the Project Manager and Marketing team thought it would be covered when held, hindering the user's view. The Project Manager suggested that further marketing research was needed to determine the usability. The Industrial Designer proposed the idea of an LCD screen to display program information, but this was met with disagreement due to cost, user behavior, vulnerability, and the need to match the basic design concept. The User Interface team suggested a menu with different options instead. The Industrial Designer expressed concern about losing the locator feature, but the Project Manager assured that a beeper would be included. The User Interface team clarified that it would not be a speaker, but a locator that beeped.",
  "139": "The User Interface team proposed a prototype for the remote control, suggesting an ergonomic shape made of wood with customizable colors. The layout included a white board under the flip, featuring a large yellow button for power, a red triangle for volume, and a green button for channel changing. The bottom had a dark blue numeric pad and an LCD screen on the flip panel. The prototype also had a customized backing and front. The remote boasted various features, such as a signal-emitting LED, an on-off switch, a mute button, nine channel buttons, volume control buttons, channel scrolling buttons, and a menu button for adjusting settings like color and brightness. Additionally, there was an elongated swapping button that allowed users to switch to the previous or next channel. The remote also had a built-in voice recognizer. The industrial designer highlighted the flexibility of the product, allowing users to add buttons and use the jog wheel to navigate the LCD display. Users could choose to use the LCD or regular buttons, and the remote also had speech recognition and a location finder function.",
  "105": "To enhance the appeal of the remote, the Industrial Designer proposed incorporating speech recognition to address the issue of dull buttons. However, concerns were raised about power consumption. As an alternative, the Industrial Designer initially suggested a beeping button on the TV set to locate the remote, but this was deemed impractical for non-company-designed TVs. The Project Manager then proposed whistle tracking, which was unanimously approved as an innovative solution. The Industrial Designer also emphasized the importance of user-friendliness, suggesting that only the most frequently used buttons be visible, with unnecessary buttons hidden behind a protective cover. Additionally, the remote should be of standard size and have a minimal number of buttons.",
  "182": "The marketing team believed that the market would prefer a remote with convenient channel browsing and volume adjustment features, rather than complex programming options. The user interface team agreed and proposed a menu display to enhance user-friendliness. The design of the buttons was discussed, with a focus on functionality for volume, channel, power, and other essential functions. The team debated the size, placement, and arrangement of the buttons, ultimately deciding to place the power button on top. The idea of a mute button was also suggested, although the project manager did not consider it important. The team liked the idea of using fluorescent lights, and the user interface designer suggested making this function tactile by using small arrows. They further discussed whether to use a battery or a naturally fluorescent material to power this function. Marketing emphasized the importance of addressing the needs of elderly users and suggested grouping the buttons based on their functions. The project manager agreed with this approach.",
  "130": "The Industrial Designer suggested using rubber as it is softer and cheaper than titanium, which would exceed the budget, and more flexible for color options. While rubber couldn't be used as the interior for protection, a rubber coating would help reduce impact if the remote control was dropped. The Industrial Designer also presented the option of using simple chips or advanced chips for the mouse, but using LCD display would significantly increase the cost. The Project Manager agreed that LCD was convenient for scroll buttons and number visibility, but decided against choosing advanced chips due to the assumption that young people may not have their own room with an LCD TV. The user interface designer highlighted the limitations of using titanium for shaping and the unsuitability of wood, suggesting a thick plastic inner shell and a durable rubber outer shell for better durability and feel.",
  "93": "The Project Manager recognized the importance of investing in rechargeable units for the remote control, as other components were considered basic. However, the cost factor was acknowledged, and the decision to produce in Taiwan would only be made if the cost was reasonable. On the other hand, the Industrial Designer believed that two batteries could provide a long lifespan for the remote control, making a rechargeable option unnecessary and potentially unattractive to customers. Despite this, the Industrial Designer proposed the idea of a rechargeable remote control with a wire for self-charging, although the feasibility of this idea was uncertain. Nevertheless, the team unanimously agreed that a rechargeable remote control would provide comfort and customers would be willing to pay for such convenience.",
  "4": "The Marketing team suggested incorporating voice control into the remote, citing research that showed three-quarters of people under 35 are in favor of this feature. They also emphasized the importance of making the remote difficult to lose compared to other brands. As a result, the Marketing team convinced the Project Manager to target the youth as their primary consumers. This decision was made because the remote would be sold worldwide and used by everyone. During a discussion about the type of remote control to be sold, the User Interface team asked whether it should be a stand-alone unit or a universal one. The Project Manager responded by suggesting that they should decide based on the desired price point of twenty-five Euros.

They decided on latex covers in fruity colors, a chip, and buttons for scrolling and power. Initially, Marketing dismissed the idea of a universal remote due to budget constraints, but the Project Manager suggested creating a basic version that could switch between stereo, VC, and TV. The group agreed to give it a try and design an affordable universal remote. They also agreed to incorporate parental control and gaming features but decided against voice recognition due to its complexity.",
  "199": "The Project Manager introduced a prototype that incorporated fashion trends, resembling a banana with a bright yellow color and a blue button. The design aimed for simplicity and ease of use, with the possibility of a curved shape and advanced hidden chips, similar to iPod features. The Industrial Designer suggested making the remote control smaller in size. The User Interface designer presented two options for functionality: multi-functional for various entertainment devices or single-functional specifically for television. The group preferred the single-functional option for its simplicity and profitability. The product needed to be compatible with different brands for international sales. The technological innovation aspect received lower grades, as it lacked standout features. The Marketing team proposed a long battery life and a locator function that would make the remote beep when users clapped, with the condition of not beeping too frequently. The group found this idea interesting and excellent. Both prototypes had special shapes, resembling surfboards. The first prototype had a simple design with an LCD display and a red on-off button, suitable for TV mode. The team considered it a standard design with an adorable shape. The second prototype had advanced speech recognition and resembled a fashionable mobile phone, with six key buttons and an orange button for the microphone. It offered speech recognition and displayed channel information on the LCD display. Both designs were lightweight, had LED indicators for battery usage, and were convenient to use. In conclusion, the Marketing team favored the size and shape of the second prototype.",
  "8": "The Project Manager expressed dissatisfaction with the prototype, noting that it was too thick and obstructed the LCD screen when held, rendering it unusable. The team evaluated the prototype based on market research and financial considerations, concluding that fancy appearance and technical innovation were mutually exclusive. Despite this, they believed their product incorporated fashion elements and aligned with their company's other products. Budget discussions ensued. The team acknowledged their creativity but identified issues in their discussion process. The Industrial Designer provided an example to improve team creativity. The team felt their teamwork was successful, although the Project Manager admitted unfamiliarity with computer operations. The prototype evaluation criteria were user-oriented and market-indicated, with high scores in all categories. The final evaluation rated the design and trend highly, while conforming to the company strategy. The marketing expert confirmed the target audience and the need for a teletext button. Fresh colors were agreed upon for better visibility, along with button numbers and texture.",
  "157": "To ensure user convenience, the team discussed the possibility of a symmetrical button design for left-handed users. However, it was concluded that this would only lead to confusion, as left-handed users can easily handle the remote control with either hand. The user interface team emphasized that a thumb is sufficient for operating the remote, regardless of hand dominance. The industrial designer mentioned that even left-handed individuals in their acquaintances use right-handed mice for computers. Marketing argued that pressing buttons on the remote would not be too difficult for left-handed users. Ultimately, the decision was made to stock both left-handed and right-handed versions of the remote to cater to a wider audience."
